# Proposals

Status: routing

This directory contains only planned or incomplete work. Proposal text is not
current language behavior unless the matching page under
`../specification/` also states it.

## Read First

- Current behavior: [Language Specification](../specification/README.md).
- Completed proposal history:
  [Implemented Proposal Records](../reference/implemented-proposals/README.md).

## Catalog

- [Parallel Test Execution](parallel-test-execution.md): use bounded,
  CPU-aware case scheduling while preserving deterministic reports, static
  gates, and a serial compatibility route.

## Selection Rule

Before implementing a proposal slice, compare it with the matching
specification page and executable cases. Do not select work that is already
covered there or only extends a numbered, width-based, arity-based, route-count,
or diagnostic-id sequence. Such work needs a concrete new capability and a
bounded stopping condition.

## Proposal Shape

Express observable targets as structured acceptance cases, decision tables,
state-transition tables, executable models, or another directly verifiable
form when practical. Map those targets to the tests, fixtures, doctests,
benchmarks, or executable specifications that will verify implementation.
Keep prose for scope, rationale, non-goals, and constraints that cannot
reasonably be expressed in the primary verification medium. Do not describe
planned evidence as already passing.

## Update When

Promote observable behavior to executable evidence under
`../../examples/specification/` first when practical, then update the smallest
matching specification page. Move completed proposal history to
`../reference/implemented-proposals/` and remove it from this catalog.
