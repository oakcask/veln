# Execution Boundary

This page routes implemented execution facts. Use it before opening the full
execution reference.

## Read First

- Checked core and typed IR are produced only after semantic diagnostics have
  no errors.
- Reachable executable blockers include holes, missing expressions,
  constructor arity gaps, call arity gaps, and recognized concurrency calls.
- JVM details are backend details unless this reference marks a behavior as an
  observable language boundary.

## Read When

- Core, typed IR, selected-entry reachability, and stdio ordering:
  [execution-full.md](execution-full.md#core-and-ir).
- JVM lowering support, runtime containers, file-system and process
  intrinsics, channels, tasks, contract failures, and the class cache:
  [execution-full.md](execution-full.md#jvm-backend).

## Skip Unless Needed

- Use [commands.md](commands.md) first for command gates and user-facing
  behavior.
- Use [json-output.md](json-output.md) first for machine-readable command
  output.
